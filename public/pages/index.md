# Hello

## and welcome to sijp-github-io

I’m Shlomi, a Full stack architect and a team leader. I used to have a blog back in the days, which had all kind of articles about Software development, Computer Graphics and Arts. And I’ve decided to start a small blog that I hope I’ll update often.

![That's me and Laika](/images/me-and-laika.jpg "Tha'ts me and Laika")

I wanted the blog to be vendor-independant, meaning it is hosted in [GitHub Page](https://github.io) and the full source code is available in my [sijp/githubIO](https://github.com/sijp/githubIO) project. It is written in VueJS and have a complete CircleCI pipeline to GitHub Pages.
